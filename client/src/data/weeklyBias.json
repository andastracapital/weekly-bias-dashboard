Sector concentration in job gains (Healthcare, Government, Leisure) limits breadth. Soft Retail Sales (0.0%), weak ADP (6.5k), and CPI miss (0.2% vs exp 0.3%) keep dovish Fed narrative alive. Trade uncertainty (Trump USMCA exit rumors, Iran deal optimism) adds volatility. Dollar remains vulnerable to data disappointments despite headline strength.",

China dairy tariffs (11.7% on EU products effective Feb 13) add trade friction. EUR benefits from Dollar weakness but lacks independent bullish drivers. Structural positioning remains defensive.",
